# Obesity Prediction Using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project focuses on binary classification to predict obesity based on lifestyle and health-related features. It explores a variety of machine learning models, including:
- Logistic Regression
- Neural Networks
- Decision Trees
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting
- XGBoost
- SVM
- Ensemble methods like Bagging and Stacking

The project emphasizes data preprocessing, feature selection, hyperparameter optimization, and model evaluation to identify the best predictors of obesity.

## Dataset
The dataset includes health and lifestyle attributes, such as:
- Eating habits (e.g., frequency of high-calorie food consumption)
- Physical activity levels
- Family history of overweight
- Demographic data (age, gender, height, weight)

## Key Results
- **Best model**: Neural Network with an accuracy of 96.5% and an AUC of 97%.
- **Feature importance**: Weight, family history of overweight, and eating habits were the most significant predictors.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- TensorFlow/Keras
- Matplotlib, Seaborn for visualization
